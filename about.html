	<h2>Necessary Devices and Assumptions</h2>
	<p>The project will consist of a Unity Project file which is where the game will be created, and an XCode build file in order for the game to be ran on mobile iPhones. From here the necessary materials needed to develop this application will be a computer that can run Unity version 2021 and an iPhone which is operating on an iOS version of 11.0 or later as well as a printer which would allow for the user to print off the identifying image, the subject of the image will be determined later. The assumption is that once the application can be installed on the iPhone that whenever the app is running on the phone and the printed image is detected that the app will be able to run, and the game will be able to be played.</p>
	<h2>Platform</h2>
	<p>The Platform that the app will run on is iOS 11.0 and higher. The interface and controls will be overlayed on the phones camera, with the controls being available on the touch screen. The controls will consist of two arrow buttons to move your defense bar and a menu screen where the player can begin the game or see the results of the game. </p>

	<h2>Assessment</h2>
	<p>The main strength of this software will be in the usability of the game app for the phone. If all the controls and menus work, and the image is easily detectable then the software would be considered successful. If this software can be used to show young children the capabilities of augmented reality then that would be incredible, but it is not the main focus of this project!</p>
