	<h1>AR Pong Game!</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The overall goal of this project is to create an AR based game. A typical scenario where this would be relevant would be in any environment that would allow for a person to demonstrate the capability of augmented reality within our phones! One could image that in classroom of children in their early development years this app would be a great introduction to the existence of augmented reality and the possibilities of augmented reality programs being implemented into many scenarios in the near future! The game will be a 3D implementation of the retro game “pong” where the user will be able to play against the computer!</p>
