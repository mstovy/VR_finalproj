# VR_finalproj

Description:

	The overall goal of this project is to create an AR based game. A typical scenario where this would be relevant would be in any environment that would allow for a person to demonstrate the capability of augmented reality within our phones! One could image that in classroom of children in their early development years this app would be a great introduction to the existence of augmented reality and the possibilities of augmented reality programs being implemented into many scenarios in the near future! The game will be a 3D implementation of the retro game “pong” where the user will be able to play against the computer!  

The project will consist of a Unity Project file which is where the game will be created, and an XCode build file in order for the game to be ran on mobile iPhones. From here the necessary materials needed to develop this application will be a computer that can run Unity version 2021 and an iPhone which is operating on an iOS version of 11.0 or later as well as a printer which would allow for the user to print off the identifying image, the subject of the image will be determined later. The assumption is that once the application can be installed on the iPhone that whenever the app is running on the phone and the printed image is detected that the app will be able to run, and the game will be able to be played.  

The Platform that the app will run on is iOS 11.0 and higher. The interface and controls will be overlayed on the phones camera, with the controls being available on the touch screen. The controls will consist of two arrow buttons to move your defense bar and a menu screen where the player can begin the game or see the results of the game.
